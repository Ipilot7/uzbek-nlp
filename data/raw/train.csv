i had stated to her the reason i feel so fearful is because i feel unsafe,"Men unga o'zimni juda qo'rqinchli his qilishimning sababini aytdim, chunki men o'zimni xavfli his qilaman",4
i didn t feel like getting shaken down by the tsa quite yet so i pulled off to the side at creative croissants for a lunch,"Men hali tsadan larzaga tushishni istamadim, shuning uchun tushlik qilish uchun ijodiy kruvasanlardan chetga chiqdim.",4
i get into groups i feel really awkward and overcompensate by being too talkative or by getting really quiet,"Men guruhlarga kiraman, o‘zimni juda noqulay his qilaman va haddan tashqari gapirayapman yoki jim bo‘lib qolaman",0
i am very excited to finally meet that companion that companion who will be with me at all times especially when i am lonely very lonely that companion who will never disappoint me that companion who will put his arms around me and make me feel loved,"Men har doim yonimda bo'ladigan o'sha hamroh bilan nihoyat uchrashganimdan juda xursandman, ayniqsa men yolg'iz qolganimda, meni hech qachon xafa qilmaydigan va meni quchoqlab, meni sevishimni his qiladigan hamroh bilan uchrashganimdan juda xursandman.",2

i was still feeling strong,Men hali ham kuchli his qilardim,1
i didn t burst into tears or some other devastating release of feelings or thoughts because i seemed to know that rich also had to go through his own space without me just dumping on him,"Men yig'lab yubormadim yoki boshqa dahshatli his-tuyg'ular yoki fikrlardan ozod bo'lmadim, chunki men boylar ham o'z makonini bosib o'tishlari kerakligini bilgandek edim.",1
i wanted to get a pumpkin spice latte this morning but it was hot and the last thing i wanted was a hot coffee maybe i am feeling a little bitter,"Men bugun ertalab qovoqli ziravorli latte olmoqchi edim, lekin u issiq edi va men xohlagan oxirgi narsa issiq qahva edi, balki o'zimni biroz achchiq his qilyapman",3
i suppose he feels badly because he was a bit skeptical of her pain over the last few months shes had a hyperchondria and exaggeration habit in the past though he never openly questioned her about it,"O'ylaymanki, u o'zini yomon his qilmoqda, chunki u so'nggi bir necha oy ichida uning og'rig'iga bir oz shubha bilan qaragan, o'tmishda u giperxondriya va bo'rttirish odati bo'lgan, lekin u hech qachon bu haqda ochiqchasiga so'ramagan.",4

i would love to go into this for two reasons i care about how people feel and im a very sweet person so i think id be good at it and helping them get through it,"Men bunga ikki sababga ko'ra odamlarning his-tuyg'ulari haqida qayg'urishni istardim va men juda shirin odamman, shuning uchun men buni yaxshi bilaman va ularga buni engib o'tishga yordam beraman deb o'ylayman",1
i was talking to elder ditlevsen the other day about my plans at college and things and how you guys were all way excited for me to get back and he told me that he remembered feeling a little nervous as a parent,O'tgan kuni men oqsoqol Ditlevsen bilan kollejdagi rejalarim va narsalarim haqida gaplashdim va sizlar mening qaytishimdan juda xursand bo'lgansizlar va u menga ota-ona sifatida biroz asabiylashganini eslaganini aytdi.,4

a girl entered in the division where i work and greeted everybody but not me,men ishlayotgan bo'limga bir qiz kirib hamma bilan salomlashdi lekin men emas,3
i try to hold my tongue try to see it from his point of view but inside i am feeling agitated and irritable about all this pressure to please him when i cannot seem to get my own self in order,"Men tilimni ushlab turishga harakat qilaman, buni uning nuqtai nazari bilan ko'rishga harakat qilaman, lekin ichimda men o'zimni tartibga keltira olmayotganimda, uni rozi qilish uchun barcha bu bosimdan hayajon va asabiylashaman",4
im in a strange situation or feeling awkward i sometimes switch into comedian mode a bit of a defence mechanism from my self conscious school days and turned some of the sessions into katrinas minute stand up routine,"Men g'alati vaziyatga tushib qoldim yoki o'zimni noqulay his qilyapman, ba'zida o'zimni anglagan maktab kunlarimdan bir oz mudofaa mexanizmini komediya rejimiga o'tkazaman va ba'zi mashg'ulotlarni katrina daqiqali turish tartibiga aylantiraman.",0
a certain friend tried to push me off a seat in a very violent way for no apparent reason it may be that he was excited about something,"bir do'stim hech qanday sababsiz meni juda zo'ravonlik bilan o'rindiqdan turtmoqchi bo'ldi, ehtimol u nimadandir hayajonlangandir",3
i was worried that it would be awkward and i would feel lonely,Bu noqulay bo'lishidan va o'zimni yolg'iz his qilishimdan xavotirda edim,0

i recently learned that there is a very slight difference between empathetic and sympathetic in definition empathetic being able to actually feel the emotion and sympathetic being the ability to understand the emotion and i realized that there is also a fine line between the two in writing,"Men yaqinda ta'rifda empatik va hamdardlik o'rtasida juda oz farq borligini bilib oldim, empatik aslida his-tuyg'uni his qila olish va hamdardlik hissiyotni tushunish qobiliyati va men yozma ravishda ikkalasi o'rtasida nozik chiziq borligini tushundim.",2

im heartbroken about in love with the world but i think maybe im feeling heartbroken so acutely is it came to me today that every time ive been asked to stay somewhere in the past years or so ive left,"Men dunyoga oshiq bo'lganimdan yuragim ezilib ketdi, lekin o'ylaymanki, men o'zimni shunchalik qattiq xafa qildimki, so'nggi yillarda har safar biron joyda qolishimni so'rashganida, men uni tark etganman.",0

i will probably just be lazy and lounge around the house and possibly go down to the pool depends how im feeling and what i can be bothered to do its my last day off before i go back to work so yeah,"Men shunchaki dangasa bo'laman va uy atrofida dam olaman va hovuzga tushishim o'zimni qanday his qilishimga va ishga qaytishdan oldin oxirgi dam olish kunim nima qilishimga bog'liq, shuning uchun ha",3
i cant help but feel excited for the part where i get to hang out with him and we can start to talk like friends talk and watch each other live our separate lives,"Men yordam berolmayman, lekin men u bilan birga bo'lganim uchun hayajonlanaman va biz do'stlar gaplashganday gaplasha boshlaymiz va bir-birimizni alohida hayotimizni tomosha qilamiz.",1

i won t say that i didn t feel any fear because i did but i was surprised at how calm i was,"Men hech qanday qo'rquvni his qilmaganimni aytmayman, chunki men qo'rquvni his qildim, lekin men qanchalik xotirjam ekanligimga hayron bo'ldim.",5
i was to do the same to them i would have this guilty conscience and i would feel like a heartless bitch,"Men ham ularga xuddi shunday qilgan bo'lardim, vijdonim azoblanadi va o'zimni yuraksiz kaltakdek his qilardim",3

im ready to start my shots again that two and a half weeks off just flies and im feeling miserable about it the thought that these peeps will be helping me through it makes it a bearable experience to the point where when this whole thing is done and dusted i will actually miss them all,"Men suratga olishimni yana boshlashga tayyorman, ikki yarim haftalik tanaffus endigina uchib ketdi va bundan o‘zimni baxtsiz his qilyapman, bu ko‘zbo‘yamachilar menga yordam berishadi, degan o‘y, hamma narsa bajarilib, changdan tozalansa, chidab bo‘lmas tajribaga aylanadi. Men ularning barchasini sog'inaman",0
i feel complacent if i were to choose the secure path probably not i think id find adventure in anything,"Agar men xavfsiz yo'lni tanlagan bo'lsam, o'zimni xotirjam his qilaman, ehtimol men hech narsada sarguzasht topaman deb o'ylamayman.",1
i give probably to the degree that some might see as too much but if i feel taken advantage of or wronged in any sense i have absolutely no problem shutting it down and walking away,"Men, ehtimol, ba'zilar juda ko'p ko'rishlari mumkin bo'lgan darajada beraman, lekin agar o'zimni biron bir ma'noda foydalanilgan yoki haqorat qilingan deb his qilsam, uni yopish va ketishda hech qanday muammo yo'q.",3

i live in philadelphia pa and i m pretty sure if he said you were just under and drove you home he was feeling sympathetic and if he was going to ticket you he would have right then and there,"Men Filadelfiyada yashayman va ishonchim komilki, agar u sizni hozirgina ostida ekanligingizni va sizni uyingizga haydab yuborganingizni aytsa, u hamdardlik bildiradi va agar u sizga chipta bermoqchi bo'lsa, u o'sha paytda va shu erda bo'lardi.",2

i actually found myself resenting the song for making me feel which is weird for me because i used to play guitar and sing in church like all the time and music was a huge part of my life in college and high school,"Men aslida qo'shiqni o'zimni his qilganim uchun g'alati his qildim, chunki men har doim gitara chalib, cherkovda qo'shiq kuylaganman va musiqa kollej va o'rta maktabda hayotimning katta qismi bo'lgan.",5
